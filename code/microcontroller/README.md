# Microcontroller Code

These are simple MicroPython scripts to be run on the ground station and satellite. The satellite interfaces with the sensors and sends LoRa packets, and the ground station simply receives and logs them.

Notably, we suspect a critical error with our mission to have happened with our LoRa and the satellite backup log: see our final presentation for slightly more detail.
