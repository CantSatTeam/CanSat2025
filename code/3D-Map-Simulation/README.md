# 3D Map Simulation

The flight path visualizer we created and used. We took a roughly 20 by 20 km area of the launch site and mapped it to Unity, using Mercator projection to convert GPS coordinates to worldspace coordinates. As we only successfully collected one data point, that is what is present on the simulation.

Note the quirky control scheme: use the mouse to drag your camera around, and use WASDQE for all movement.
