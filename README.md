# 2025 CSDCMS CanSat Competition: Can'tSat

**Note 1: Our project experienced failures on launch day (see our [final presentation](presentations/Can'tSat%20Final%20Presentation.pdf)). Use at your own risk.**

This repository contains the entirety of the Can'tSat team's submission to the 2025 CSDCMS CanSat Competition.

Acts as a multi-purpose tool used to collect data relevant to pilots. Has 2 main facets:
1. Collects AMDAR data and formats into a valid string using the specifications of the World Meteorological Organization. This data can be sent to ground stations for processing, which then sends human-readable data back to pilots.
2. Plots flight path alongside other flight data in a 3D Unity simulation of the launch site. This could be used as a visualization system for atmospheric data for pilots to directly interact with.

For more details, see our [presentations](presentations), especially our [final report](presentations/Can'tSat%20Final%20Report.tex).
