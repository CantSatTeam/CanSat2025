# Structure

We used Fusion 360 to model our CanSat design for 3D printing. We developed a threaded design here, where the shell screws onto the base, allowing for simple removal and strong attachment.

With our printer, the caps from the first file fit perfectly with the shell from the second file. We suspect this will generally not be the case for reproductions, but it may be worth mentioning.

We used 2 metal rods attached at opposite corners of the caps to fasten the can together. We believe this is part of the reason our can was able to stay in one piece.
